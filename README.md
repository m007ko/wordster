Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over More Tools, then select Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.Extensions page (chrome://extensions)
Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. If no extension icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension. 

Pin the extension

Pin your extension to the toolbar to quickly access your extension during development.
Pinning the extension
Click the extension's action icon (toolbar icon); you should see a popup.
